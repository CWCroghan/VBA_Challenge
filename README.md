#Project Overview
When advicing clients about possible stock purchases,it is common to review the past performance of the stocks.  Although past performance of a stock does not guarentee the future performance, it can provide insight into the quality of the company in that companies that have shown to be successful in the past tend to be more likely to be successful in the future.
Intially, when approached about doing some stock preformance calculations, the analysis were limited to only one year and only one stock ticker.  Being intially concerned about getting an answer with minimal programming effort, hardcoding was utilized to capture the specified features of  stock ticker and year of concern.  Then the client requested information concerning the full-range of available stocks and multible years.  Instead of continuing with the original code, it was determined that we should refactor the original code with less hardcoding and more flexiblity utilizing additional features of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) for example arrays.

Results:

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between
2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the
refactored script.


Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions. What are the
advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? How do these pros and cons
apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
